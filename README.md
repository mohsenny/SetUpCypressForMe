# SetupCypress for me
While supporting both Windows and MacOS, the purpose of this script is to:
- Install Cypress,
- Set up a sample spec test in place,
- Create a `cypress.json` config file, and
- Add a command to the `package.json` to run the test(s)

## How it works?
1. Copy the `setupCypress.js` script to the location where you like to install Cypress
2. Run the script:
```
node setupCypress.js
```
